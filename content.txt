1.Class and Object (example)
2.Class has data/attribute and func/methods
  > Code walkthrough
  > Attributes get called itself, methods are called manually
3.Why python is called OOP? - everything in Python is an object (data structure, data type etc)
4.Advantages of OOPs :
  > you can create your own datatype
  > code reusability
  > debugging
  > easy to colab 

5.End to end Project (Chatbook class)
  > function vs method
  > magic method or dunder method (eg. __init__, __add__, etc)
  > self      
  > You can create attribute outside class as well

  > encapsulation-
  Encapsulation in Python is a fundamental principle of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that involves bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data into a single unit, typically a class. 
  It also involves restricting direct access to some of an object's components to protect the data from accidental modification.

  Example:
  class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
       self.__age = age # Private attribute

  p1 = Person("Emil", 25)
  # print(p1.__age) # This will raise an AttributeError


  > getter and setter - method to get hidden attribute and set hidden attribute
  > static method

  > Inheritance
  > Inheritance code example
  > Why inheritance is needed? (code reuseability, parent has no access to child class)
  > what gets inherited? Constructor, Non private attributes, Non private methods
  > constructor overloading & method overloading
  > Super keyword(can be used only inside class, can not access variables/attributes, used only inside child class)

  > Types of inheritance  1. Single Inheritance |  2. Multilevel |  3. Hierarchical |  4. Multiple <Diamond Problem> |  5. Hybrid
